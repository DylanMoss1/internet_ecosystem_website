## The Business Idea

My idea was that we could give monitary rewards to people shopping at more eco-friendly companies. Companies could pay a commission for us to advertise them on our website and in return we can pay that back to our customers. Customers visit our website to see a list of companies participating, they can then go to their website through our website and gain cashback for any purchases made. This basic model has already been proven to work with other companies such as Quidco and TopCashback but my twist was that, since this is a not-for-profit organisation to help protect the environment, we can give our profits as bonuses to customers who shop at more eco-friendly websites and buy more eco-friendly products. Using a combination of our chrome extension and independent reviews of the eco-friendliness of companies, we can judge which companies customers will be rewarded extra for shopping at. 

This means that customers get monitary rewards in return for shopping with us and are also incentivised to shop at more eco-friendly companies to gain a greater cashback reward. 

If this product gained large traction, the large scale impact of this product would be that companies may endevour to be more eco-friendly to try and give their customers better cashback rewards (for the same commission rate) and encourage customers to buy more products from them.

I have had some experience with website back-end development but have had very little experience with front-end development. Despite the fact that the website wasn't fully complete and some of the links didn't work, I think that the development of the website was a success as I was able to deploy a working website in a short amount of time with
